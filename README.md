# Business-Intelligence-Presentation
This repository is about Business intelligence presentation. In this, there is proposal for the presentation with the final presentation

## Introduction - 

In this proposal, I am going to prepare the plan for the business Intelligence presentation. In today's world, understanding and predicting customer churn is very important when you are trying to figure out who are the loyal customers and who are not. This Business Intelligence presentation will focus on the prediction of customer churn, which is very important in the field of banking.
The goal of this presentation is to know the key factors influencing customer churn. Also to discuss how it is important to have data-driven insights to keep the customer retention rate high. 

## Presentation Candidate - 

My name is Rajas Joshi and I have done my bachelor's in Business Administration. I have 7 months of work experience working as an Incident Manager at Accenture India. My primary duty was to create daily reports using Microsoft Excel and Power BI showing the daily progress of the tickets resolved on the Service Now.

## Data Selection - 

The dataset that I have chosen today is called churn modeling, which has information about the customers of the bank around the globe. This data set contains columns such as customer_ID, surname, credit score, the geography of the customer that is where are they located, gender of the customer, age, number of products they have bought, is that the customer active member, estimated salary of the customer, and that customer is still with that bank or not. The reason why I chose this topic is because I wanted to know what is the retention rate of the bank towards the customer and how many products and services those customers are using and are they happy with the product and services that they are getting.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration - 

In this proposal, I have tried to explain what are the different business intelligence techniques that I have used to analyze the bank churn dataset.  
This process starts with the data cleaning and processing of the data to ensure the data set is ready for the analysis and this includes handling the missing values, and changing the column names or column types where they are needed using Jupyter Notebook. Finally, after all the data cleaning and EDA is done I'm going to create a dashboard using the Power BI visualizations that will highlight some important insights from the dataset. Power BI dashboard will mostly focus on the age distribution of the customer, gender distribution by product, geographical locations of the customer, what is the churn rate, and so on. 
These insights will help banks understand identifying high-risk segments that are more prone to churn. These insights will allow Banks to make decisions based on the above-mentioned criteria allowing them to make a personalized offering to retain their customers and to reduce their churn rates.

## Implementation Plan - 

Week 1 - 
Gather and prepare a data set for the presentation.
Finalization on what techniques I will be using with Jupyter Notebook. 
Week 2 - 
Design the criteria and parameters based on what the Power BI dashboard will be made.
Start working on the power wheel dashboard.
Week 3 - 
Finalize the Power BI dashboard with polished visualizations and storytelling elements.
The tools that I will be using throughout this process will be a Power BI desktop, Jupiter notebooks, and the libraries such as Pandas. The data set that I will be working on is churn modeling.


## Conclusion - 

In conclusion, The proposal gives an idea about the overall plan to make a Power BI  presentation on the Churn modeling dataset which I have obtained from Kaggle. The business intelligence presentation on the bank customers churn prediction will be done by using Power BI, I will be aiming to provide insights into customer behavior and potential churn factors. Through the visualizations, I will be highlighting key metrics like demographics, credit score, product usage, and identifying pattern that indicates churn.
